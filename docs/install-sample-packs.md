# Use sample data packs with your Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription

You can install sample data packs on your Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription. Sample data packs save you time by automatically installing data and content you need to build and test your solutions. This includes fictitious users, metadata, and photos to simulate a small corporate environment. You can quickly install the sample data so that you can focus on your solutions rather than spend time creating sample data yourself.

You can find sample data packs on your [Microsoft 365 Developer Program dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/profile), at the bottom of your subscription tile.

The following sample data packs are currently available:

  - Get specific user details
  - Update user
  - Get direct reports
  - Prepare organization chart  
  - Get users by department

- Mail and events - Adds Outlook email conversations and calendar events for each of the 16 sample users. Use Microsoft Graph APIs to work with mail and events sample data in the following ways:
  - Get emails by users

  - Update/delete upcoming events

> [!NOTE]
> You must install the Users sample data pack before you install Mail and Events.
